# AGENT SURVIVAL PARAMETERS
# ===========================================
# Fine-tune agent survival thresholds for different simulation scenarios

survival:
  # Hunger thresholds (0-100 scale, death at 100)
  hunger:
    critical: 85          # EAT NOW OR DIE! - Emergency survival mode
    urgent: 60            # EAT immediately - High priority action
    high_priority: 40     # EAT when convenient - Normal eating behavior
    medium_priority: 25   # Consider eating - Proactive food management
    
  # Thirst thresholds (0-100 scale, death at 100)  
  thirst:
    critical: 85          # DRINK NOW OR DIE! - Emergency survival mode
    urgent: 60            # DRINK immediately - High priority action
    high_priority: 40     # DRINK when convenient - Normal drinking behavior
    medium_priority: 25   # Consider drinking - Proactive water management
    
  # Energy thresholds (0-100 scale, death at 0)
  energy:
    critical: 15          # Death imminent - No non-essential actions
    low: 30              # Conserve movements - Limited action budget
    breeding_min: 50      # Minimum energy required for reproduction

# ===========================================
# AI CONTROLLER BEHAVIOR
# ===========================================
# Configure different AI decision-making systems

ai_behavior:
  # Simple Rule-Based Controller
  simple_controller:
    high_priority_hunger: 50     # Hunger level triggering immediate food search
    high_priority_thirst: 50     # Thirst level triggering immediate water search
    medium_priority_hunger: 30   # Hunger level for opportunistic eating
    medium_priority_thirst: 30   # Thirst level for opportunistic drinking
    emergency_energy: 20         # Energy level triggering survival mode
    basic_needs_hunger: 40       # Standard hunger management threshold
    basic_needs_thirst: 40       # Standard thirst management threshold
    
  # Advanced Language Model Controller
  vlm_controller:
    urgent_hunger: 70            # Hunger level for urgent eating prompts
    urgent_thirst: 70            # Thirst level for urgent drinking prompts
    recommended_hunger: 40       # Hunger level for eating recommendations
    recommended_thirst: 40       # Thirst level for drinking recommendations
    low_priority_hunger: 20      # Hunger level for low-priority eating hints
    low_priority_thirst: 20      # Thirst level for low-priority drinking hints
    resource_shortage_hunger: 70 # Hunger threshold during resource scarcity
    resource_shortage_thirst: 70 # Thirst threshold during resource scarcity

# ===========================================
# BREEDING AND POPULATION
# ===========================================
# Control agent reproduction and population dynamics

breeding:
  min_age: 50                   # Minimum age before agents can reproduce
  pregnancy_duration: 30        # Number of turns for pregnancy to complete
  max_population: 50            # Maximum agents before breeding restrictions
  min_energy: 50               # Minimum energy required for breeding attempts
  fertility_decline_age: 200    # Age when fertility begins declining

# ===========================================
# RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
# ===========================================
# Configure inventory limits and resource collection behavior

resources:
  max_inventory_food: 2         # Maximum food items an agent can carry
  max_inventory_water: 2        # Maximum water items an agent can carry
  pickup_threshold_food: 2      # Food items needed before pickup priority increases
  pickup_threshold_water: 2     # Water items needed before pickup priority increases

# ===========================================
# WORLD PARAMETERS
# ===========================================
# Configure the simulation environment

world:
  default_width: 15             # Default world width (can be overridden by command line)
  default_height: 20            # Default world height (can be overridden by command line)
  observation_radius: 2         # How far agents can see around themselves

# ===========================================
# PERFORMANCE SETTINGS
# ===========================================
# Optimize simulation performance and data collection

performance:
  stats_report_interval: 10     # How often to print population statistics
  memory_size: 50              # Number of memories each agent retains
  recent_memories_count: 5      # Number of recent memories to prioritize

# ===========================================
# DEATH CONDITIONS (Reference)
# ===========================================
# These values are handled automatically by the agent system

death_conditions:
  hunger_death: 100            # Hunger level that causes death
  thirst_death: 100            # Thirst level that causes death  
  energy_death: 0              # Energy level that causes death

# CONFIGURATION TIPS
# ===========================================
#
# For Research Simulations:
# - Set higher survival thresholds for more challenging conditions
# - Increase max_population for larger scale studies
# - Adjust breeding parameters for population dynamics research
#
# For Game Development:
# - Lower survival thresholds for more forgiving gameplay
# - Adjust observation_radius for different difficulty levels
# - Modify resource limits for inventory management mechanics
#
# For AI Training:
# - Use stricter survival conditions to generate crisis scenarios
# - Adjust VLM controller thresholds for different training objectives
# - Modify world size for different spatial reasoning challenges
#
# Remember to restart the simulation after changing configuration values!
