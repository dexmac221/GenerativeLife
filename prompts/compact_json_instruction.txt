⚡ USE SEQUENCES! Concrete Examples:

IMMEDIATE SITUATION EXAMPLES:
Scenario: On FOOD cell, hunger=70, thirst=60, water nearby:
✅ GOOD: {{"command": "PICKUP,EAT,MOVE_RIGHT,PICKUP,DRINK", "think": "Collecting current food, eating, moving to water, collecting and drinking for complete nutrition"}}
❌ BAD: {{"command": "EAT", "think": "Just eating"}} (wastes opportunities!)

Scenario: Male agent, female visible, both moderate health:
✅ GOOD: {{"command": "MOVE_TO_MATE,REPLICATE,EAT,DRINK", "think": "Moving to female mate, reproducing, then maintaining health"}}
❌ BAD: {{"command": "MOVE_UP", "think": "Moving towards agent"}} (no clear purpose!)

Scenario: Critical hunger=95, food+water cluster ahead:
✅ GOOD: {{"command": "MOVE_UP,PICKUP,EAT,PICKUP,DRINK", "think": "Emergency nutrition: moving to resources, collecting food, eating immediately, then drinking"}}
❌ BAD: {{"command": "MOVE_UP", "think": "Going to food"}} (too slow in crisis!)

PRIORITY SEQUENCES:
- SURVIVAL: "PICKUP,EAT,DRINK" or "EAT,DRINK" (maintain health!)
- EFFICIENCY: "MOVE_TO_RESOURCE,PICKUP,EAT,MOVE_TO_WATER,PICKUP,DRINK" 
- REPRODUCTION: "MOVE_TO_MATE,REPLICATE" (when male+female nearby)
- EXPLORATION: "MOVE_TO_UNKNOWN,PICKUP,EAT" (discover and collect)

Rules: Only move to EMPTY/FOOD/WATER cells. Never BOUNDARY/OBSTACLE.
