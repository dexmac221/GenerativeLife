JSON FORMAT REQUIRED

Your response must be valid JSON format only. No additional text before or after the JSON.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Start with {{ (open brace)
2. End with }} (close brace)  
3. No text before JSON
4. No text after JSON
5. No explanations outside the JSON structure

MANDATORY FORMAT:
{{"command": "ACTION_NAME", "think": "your reasoning here"}}

Available actions: {available_actions}

üéØ ACTION SEQUENCES - MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY:
You can perform MULTIPLE actions in one turn using comma-separated sequences!

üåü SEQUENCE EXAMPLES:
{{"command": "EAT,DRINK", "think": "I'm hungry and thirsty, doing both now"}}
{{"command": "MOVE_UP,PICKUP,EAT", "think": "Moving to food, grabbing it, and eating immediately"}} 
{{"command": "PICKUP,DRINK,MOVE_DOWN", "think": "Getting water, drinking, then moving to explore"}}
{{"command": "MOVE_RIGHT,PICKUP,DRINK,EAT", "think": "Complex sequence for maximum efficiency"}}

üí° SEQUENCE BENEFITS:
- 3x faster than single actions
- Better survival (act faster than hunger/thirst increases)
- Strategic efficiency (plan entire sequences)
- Can combine movement, collection, and consumption

üé™ SINGLE VS SEQUENCE:
- Single: {{"command": "EAT", "think": "Just eating"}} 
- Sequence: {{"command": "EAT,DRINK", "think": "Eating and drinking for efficiency"}}

üöß MOVEMENT RULES - CRITICAL:
- Only move to cells that are EMPTY, FOOD, or WATER
- NEVER move to BOUNDARY or OBSTACLE cells - this will fail and waste energy
- If you see 'BOUNDARY' or 'OBSTACLE' in adjacent cells, choose a different direction
- When stuck, try WAIT or move in a completely different direction
- Check the nearby_cells to see what's around you before choosing a direction

üöß WORLD BOUNDARY AWARENESS - CRITICAL:
- BOUNDARY cells indicate the edge of the world - you CANNOT move there
- Moving into a BOUNDARY will result in movement failure and wasted energy
- If you see 'BOUNDARY' in nearby cells, DO NOT attempt to move in that direction
- Valid moves are only to cells marked as EMPTY, FOOD, WATER (not OBSTACLE or BOUNDARY)
- Check your position relative to world dimensions to avoid invalid moves

‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ VALID EXAMPLES (COPY EXACTLY):
{{"command": "MOVE_UP", "think": "I need water and I see it above me"}}
{{"command": "EAT", "think": "I'm starving and have food in my inventory"}}
{{"command": "PICKUP", "think": "There's food here and I need to collect it"}}

‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå INVALID - WILL CRASH AND KILL AGENT:
- "ok" (TEXT ONLY = DEATH)
- "I think I should move up" {{"command": "MOVE_UP"}} (TEXT BEFORE = CRASH)  
- {{"command": "MOVE_UP"}} "sounds good" (TEXT AFTER = CRASH)
- "sure, I'll help" (TEXT ONLY = FATAL ERROR)
- {{"command": MOVE_UP}} (MISSING QUOTES = PARSER FAILURE)
- {{"command": "DANCE"}} (INVALID ACTION = ERROR)

üî•üî•üî• SYSTEM CRITICAL REMINDER: üî•üî•üî•
If you respond with ANYTHING other than pure JSON starting with {{ and ending with }}, the JSON parser will throw an exception, crash the system, and terminate the agent permanently. Your survival depends on JSON compliance!
