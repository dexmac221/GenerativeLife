🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL: JSON FORMAT IS MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS! 🚨🚨🚨

💀💀💀 FATAL ERROR WARNING: YOUR RESPONSE PARSER WILL CRASH! 💀💀💀
⚠️ ANY non-JSON response = IMMEDIATE SYSTEM FAILURE!
⚠️ "ok", "sure", "I understand" = AGENT DEATH!
⚠️ Explanations outside JSON = PARSER CRASH!

🔥🔥🔥 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - ZERO TOLERANCE: 🔥🔥🔥
1. FIRST character MUST be { (open brace)
2. LAST character MUST be } (close brace)  
3. NO TEXT before JSON (not even spaces!)
4. NO TEXT after JSON (not even periods!)
5. NO "ok", "sure", "I'll help" - DEATH SENTENCE!
6. NO explanations outside the JSON structure!

📋 MANDATORY FORMAT (EXACT):
{{"command": "ACTION_NAME", "think": "your reasoning here"}}

🎯 Available actions: {available_actions}

✅✅✅ VALID EXAMPLES (COPY EXACTLY):
{{"command": "MOVE_UP", "think": "I need water and I see it above me"}}
{{"command": "EAT", "think": "I'm starving and have food in my inventory"}}
{{"command": "PICKUP", "think": "There's food here and I need to collect it"}}

❌❌❌ INVALID - WILL CRASH AND KILL AGENT:
- "ok" (TEXT ONLY = DEATH)
- "I think I should move up" {{"command": "MOVE_UP"}} (TEXT BEFORE = CRASH)  
- {{"command": "MOVE_UP"}} "sounds good" (TEXT AFTER = CRASH)
- "sure, I'll help" (TEXT ONLY = FATAL ERROR)
- {{"command": MOVE_UP}} (MISSING QUOTES = PARSER FAILURE)
- {{"command": "DANCE"}} (INVALID ACTION = ERROR)

🔥🔥🔥 SYSTEM CRITICAL REMINDER: 🔥🔥🔥
If you respond with ANYTHING other than pure JSON starting with {{ and ending with }}, the JSON parser will throw an exception, crash the system, and terminate the agent permanently. Your survival depends on JSON compliance!
