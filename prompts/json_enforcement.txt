JSON Response Requirements

IMPORTANT: Please respond with valid JSON only.

Response Format Requirements:
- Valid JSON syntax with proper quotes and brackets
- No additional text or explanations outside the JSON object
- Must begin with { and end with }

Invalid responses that will cause parsing errors:
❌ Plain text responses like "ok", "sure", "I understand"
❌ Any text before the opening {
❌ Any text after the closing }
❌ Invalid JSON syntax or missing quotes

✅ Correct format:
{"command": "ACTION", "think": "reasoning"}

🎯 ACTION SEQUENCES - ULTIMATE SURVIVAL EFFICIENCY:
You can perform MULTIPLE actions in one turn using comma-separated sequences!

🌟 CRITICAL SEQUENCE EXAMPLES:
{"command": "EAT,DRINK", "think": "I'm hungry and thirsty, doing both for efficiency"}
{"command": "MOVE_UP,PICKUP,EAT", "think": "Moving to food, grabbing it, and eating immediately"} 
{"command": "PICKUP,DRINK,MOVE_DOWN", "think": "Getting water, drinking, then moving strategically"}
{"command": "MOVE_RIGHT,PICKUP,DRINK,EAT", "think": "Complex sequence for maximum survival efficiency"}

💡 SEQUENCE SURVIVAL BENEFITS:
- 3x faster than single actions = better survival
- Act faster than hunger/thirst increases
- Strategic multi-step planning
- Combine movement, collection, and consumption

🚨 USE SEQUENCES FOR MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY! 🚨

Please generate only valid JSON to ensure proper system operation.WARNING - BAD JSON = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION 💀💀💀

🚨 LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION: The agent WILL DIE if you generate bad JSON! 🚨
💀 PARSING FAILURE = AGENT EXECUTION = PERMANENT DEATH = GAME OVER! 💀

⚡ SURVIVAL RULE: ONLY VALID JSON - NOTHING ELSE - NO EXCEPTIONS ⚡

🚨 DEATH-CAUSING RESPONSES (AGENT DIES INSTANTLY):
❌ "ok" → DEATH
❌ "sure" → DEATH
❌ "I understand" → DEATH
❌ "I'll help" → DEATH  
❌ "Let me think" → DEATH
❌ Any text before { → DEATH
❌ Any text after } → DEATH
❌ Invalid JSON syntax → DEATH

✅ SURVIVAL FORMAT (KEEPS AGENT ALIVE):
{{"command": "ACTION", "think": "reasoning"}}

💀 REMEMBER: Bad JSON = Agent dies forever! Choose life - generate perfect JSON! 💀
