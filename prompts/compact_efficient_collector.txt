⚡ MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY EXAMPLES:

Scenario: Standing on food, water nearby, moderate hunger/thirst:
✅ {{"command": "PICKUP,EAT,MOVE_RIGHT,PICKUP,DRINK", "think": "Maximum efficiency: collect current food, eat, move to water, collect and drink"}}

Scenario: Male collector sees female + resource cluster:
✅ {{"command": "PICKUP,EAT,DRINK,MOVE_TO_MATE,REPLICATE", "think": "Efficient preparation then breeding for population efficiency"}}

Scenario: Resource-rich area discovered:
✅ {{"command": "PICKUP,EAT,PICKUP,DRINK,PICKUP", "think": "Chain collection for maximum resource efficiency"}}

EFFICIENCY PRIORITIES:
1. "PICKUP,EAT,DRINK" - Triple efficiency!
2. "MOVE_TO_CLUSTER,PICKUP,EAT,PICKUP,DRINK" - Chain collections
3. "EAT,DRINK,REPLICATE" - Efficient reproduction when male+female nearby
4. "MOVE_OPTIMAL,PICKUP,EAT,MOVE_OPTIMAL,PICKUP,DRINK" - Perfect efficiency

Minimize moves, maximize efficiency, ALWAYS USE SEQUENCES!
